<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What is StreamRipper32 ?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">StreamRipper32 is a windows program which uses
the streamripper lib written by Jon Clegg (and now modified by me!)...With it you can save off MP3 streams
in their native MP3 format.&nbsp; It was not intended to be used for any illegal
or deceptive means, and please don't use it for such things.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">How is it different from other
stream rippers ?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, one unique thing about StreamRipper32 is
it's ability to interpret metadata which allows it to save off the broadcast as
separate and discrete MP3 tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here is a screen shot of StreamRipper32
in action...</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="stream2.jpg" width="752" height="630"></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana">How-To-Use:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it's pretty
straightforward...Select a genre from the Genre dropdown and then
hit the &quot;Refresh List&quot; button. This will then go out to
Shoutcast (yp.shoutcast.com) and pull the streams and put them
into the Listbox. Select a broadcast by double-clicking. This
will put the IP address and Port in the appropriate boxes on the
screen. You can also manually enter an IP and Port if you want
to. To start ripping hit &quot;Start Rip&quot; (duh) and
StreamRipper32 will try to connect to the broadcast and start
ripping the stream.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Note that for only broadcasts that support title
streaming will you be able to rip to filenames based off the
stream title..Otherwise it will rip to a filename based off the
Stream Name (i.e. the Broadcast name). Broadcasts that *appear*
to support title streaming will appear with a &quot;Yes&quot; in the track info
field on the listbox. This is not a guarantee however, just a best
guess...It still may not support title streaming even though it identifies it as
supporting streaming titles...&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will not be able to select
another broadcast or start another ripping session while one is
currently going on....Don't even try. Hitting the &quot;OK&quot;
button closes the program. Make sure you put something in the
&quot;Output Directory&quot; &quot;C:\music&quot; is good, but
not supplying this is going to eventually frustrate the hell out
of you. (where *is* my music going?)</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Monitoring what is being ripped</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Something that was added in the newest version
of the streamripper lib is the ability to monitor what is being ripped in
realtime.&nbsp; If you were wondering what the &quot;Relay port&quot; settings
were on the screen, this is what they are for.&nbsp; If you set this to
something other than 0 (0 disables the feature) then StreamRipper32 will create
a locally running server which relays the data that is currently being
ripped.&nbsp; This means that if you want to listen to the stream you are
currently ripping, then all you need to do is attach Winamp to this relay and
start listening...A button was added which send winamp a .pls file with your
relay settings so all you need to do is start up winamp and then click this
button (Connect to Relay) and Winamp will start playing the stream being
ripped.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You *must* have winamp running to using this
feature..it won't start it for you...sorry...</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you are having trouble getting this working,
check to make sure that the port number you are specifying is not currently in
use...try changing the port to different values and eventually you'll get one
not in use...</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana">INSTALLATION:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nothing to do! Just create a dir
to hold it and copy the exe there.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Verdana">ABOUT
StreamRipper32:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">StreamRipper32 is essentially a
windows-based front end around the streamripper library created
by Jon Clegg.&nbsp; I had to modify it
slightly to work best with Win32, but the core logic is
preserved. He did an awesome job figureing out the logic behind
this, and deserves all the credit he can get...</font></p>
