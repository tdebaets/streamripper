This documents how to get you up, running and using StreamRipper.  

Well, it's pretty straightforward...Select a genre from the Genre
dropdown and then hit the "Refresh List" button.  This will then go
out to Shoutcast (yp.shoutcast.com) and pull the streams and put them
into the Listbox.  Select a broadcast by double-clicking.  This will
put the IP address and Port in the appropriate boxes on the screen.

You can also manually enter an IP and Port if you want to.

To start ripping hit "Rip Away" (duh) and StreamRipper32 will try to
connect to the broadcast and start ripping the stream.

There are a few instances where this technique still does not work...
Send me the broadcast IP and port and I can try to resolve them as they
popup. Otherwise, try another station.  Note that for only broadcasts that
support title streaming will you be able to rip to filenames based off
the stream title..Otherwise it will rip to a filename based off the 
Stream Name (i.e. the Broadcast name).  Broadcasts that *appear* to
support title streaming will appear with a "***" prepended to the name. 
This is not a guarantee, just a best guess...It still may not support
title streaming even though there is a "***" in front of it...

If you check the "Append stream name to output dir" option, then
StreamRipper32 will create a directory for you based off the Stream Name.
This is especially nice and a bonus feature.. :)

You will not be able to select another broadcast or start another ripping
session while one is currently going on....Don't even try.

Hitting the "OK" button closes the program.

Make sure you put something in the "Output Directory" "C:\music" is good,
but not supplying this is going to eventually frustrate the hell out of you.
(where *is* my music going?)

INSTALLATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing to do! Just create a dir to hold it and copy the exe there.


ABOUT StreamRipper32:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
StreamRipper32 is essentially a windows-based front end around the
streamripper library created by Jon Clegg (www.bigfreakinserver.com).
I had to modify it slightly to work best with Win32, but the core logic is
preserved.  He did an awesome job figureing out the logic behind this, and
deserves all the credit he can get...
