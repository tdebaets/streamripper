The installation of StreamRipper32 is fairly straight forward.


Windows:
  Build:
	The main project file is located in the root directory. 
	The file sripper.dsw builds all the modules. 
	It has been built and is only supported using Visual C++ 6.0.

  Install:   
	The default action is to build the executable in the root\Release directory.
	The executable only depends on runtime MFC libs and should be fairly self contained
	(i.e. no 3rd party libs or dlls besides MFC).
