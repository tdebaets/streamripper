new in 1.30b (win32 & nix)
--------------

* Added option to never overwrite files in the incomplete directory
* UserAgent fix for picky streams (fakes winamp)
* Fix for "INVALID_TRACK_SEPARATION" message.
* Options dialog now has tabs w/ WinXP look and feel (if you have XP)
* Proxy field now understands auth (user:pass@server:port) format.
* pretty massive changes to handling of threads, might use slightly less CPU usage under windows, should use MUCH less under *nix (once the *nix backport is done)
* Fixed moves files from incomplete to main directory
