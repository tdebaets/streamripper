  (lib/types.h, lib/http.c) -Colin D. Bennett <cbennett@radsoft.com>
* Fixed a couple of tiny memory leaks in the usage of b64enc(), the
  returned buffer allocated as 'string' in b64enc wasn't being freed,
  and the 'authbuf' malloc'd in httplib_construct_sc_request for the 
  proxy authorization wasn't freed.
  (lib/http.c) -Colin D. Bennett <cbennett@radsoft.com>

less CPU usage under windows, should use MUCH less under *nix (once 
the *nix backport is done)
* Fixed moves files from incomplete to main directory

Changes in 1.0.4
----------------
* Fixed mpglib stuff.

Changes in 1.0.3
----------------
* Removed live365 ripping (legal reasons)

Changes in 1.0.2
----------------
* Merged back in with Win32 build, fixed live365.com ripping
* fixed thread creation timing bug, would happen on some linux 
machines, sometimes.
* fixed bug that would cause divide by zero when mpglib failed 
very (very) badly
* Trims track names, for some reason some track names contained \r's

Changes in 1.0.1
----------------
* ported to win32 and made a winamp plug-in
* made all socket I/O non blocking
* should quite faster now

Changes in 1.0b
----------------
* Finds silence between tracks by decoding the MP3 with mpglib
* Rips live365 streams
* Creates shoutcast relay server for listening for listening to streams
* Separates incomplete tracks
* Uses cvs @ sourceforge.net
* supports icecast mount points
* proxy support
* More.. much much more..

Changes in 0.7.0
----------------
* Started playing around with cvs at sourceforge.net

Changes in 0.7.0b
----------------
* Split up streamripper_lib into ripper.c and sockets.c
* Made start_ripping asynchronous via threads. This is mainly due 
to problems with people implementing the library under a windowed 
environment. it should be quite easy to make a GUI frontend now
* Added a -o option via request. this creates a directory after the 
the stream name and puts the tracks in there, pretty nifty
* MPEG 2.5 frames are now handles correctly, this caused 
"too many errors in mp3 data"  errors before
* Errors in the mp3 data do not stop the ripping anymore.
* added -n option via request. this waits until the next track 
before ripping to  avoid getting a half done tracks
* Uses automake now, doh

Changes in 0.6.4
----------------
* new code to process options due to win32 not supported getopt
* compiles under win32 :)
